# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

1.	Using the anaconda-navigator to launch the jupyter notebook
2.	Create and navigate folders path
3.	Using pandas groupby, count and sum functions to get the total numbers of rides, drivers, and fares
4.	Calculate average fares for rides and drivers for each city type
5.	Create a pivot table to display data clearly
6.	Create a line chart using the matlab method


## Purpose and Analysis

    The main purpose of the analysis is to highlight the total and average fares for rides and drivers for each city type. This is done by creating a line chart to display the data. The analysis also provides insight that can help the CEO address the disparity of fares and drivers across all location types.


## Results

    Through the summary data frame and the line plot showing total weekly fares for each city type, there are distinct differences in the ride sharing data generated.
    
Urban city information shows more total drivers than rides
*   Drivers had lowest average fares among all location types
*   A ride in the urban city generated the lowest fare among all location types

Rural city has least amount of total drivers
    * Rural city has the least demand for rides
    * Drivers in the rural city has the highest average fares
    * A ride in the rural city is the highest among all location types

Suburban has the second highest number of drivers
    * Second highest average fare per ride and drivers

    * Volume of fares peak around mid to end February for all city types
    * Fare volume increases for urban and rural at the end of March, while suburban decreases slightly during this period
    * Suburban reaches high number of rides in April, while rural and urban locations decrease slightly during this period

## Summary

    Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
    
   1.	Increasing the number of drivers in rural cities to address any potential for driver shortages
   2.	Increasing fares per drivers/rides in urban cities, to take advantage of higher volume, particularly for peak hours in a given day or peak times during the year
   3.	If possible, incentivize excess urban drivers to cover fares for rural and suburban rides; this will promote equal distribution of rides according to demand of rides.
